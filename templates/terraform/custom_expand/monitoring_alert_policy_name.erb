<%# The upstream API expects name to be `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/alertPolicies/[POLICY_ID]` but
    we are storing just the {POLICY_ID} as the id/name in terraform state. This is because 
    import logic constructs a url from the id as isn't currently tolerant of id's that are
    also full self links. So instead we must translate between the 2 formats in expanders %>
