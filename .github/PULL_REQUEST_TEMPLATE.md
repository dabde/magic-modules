**Release Note Template for Downstream PRs (will be copied)**

```release-note:replace-me

```

<!--
Release notes should be formatted with one of the following headings.
- release-note:bug
- release-note:note
- release-note:new-resource
- release-note:new-datasource
- release-note:deprecation
- release-note:breaking-change

Notes should:
- Start with a verb
- Use past tense (added/fixed/resolved) as much as possible
- Only use present tense in imperative sentences to suggest future behavior for
  breaking changes/deprecations ("Use X" vs "You should use X" or "Users should use X")
- Impersonal third person (no “I”, “you”, etc.)
- Start with `{{service}}` if changing an existing resource (see exampels below)

For example:

`compute`: added `foo_bar` field to `google_compute_foo` resource
`container`: deprecated `region` and `zone` on `google_container_unicorn`. Use `location` instead.

If you are adding a new resource or datasource, simply list the name(s) of the new resources or datasources.

`google_compute_new_resource`
`google_compute_new_datasource`
